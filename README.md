# random-password-generator

Description

The attached project file(s) are for our third challenge as part of the UC Berkeley full stack coding bootcamp. The goal of the challenge was to add to existing javascript code for a random password generator. Some of the key instructions for the project were to make sure that we leveraged a series or 'prompt' and 'confirm' functions, which would allow the user to decide on the content of the random password they received - whether it had upper / lower case letters, numeric, and / or special characters. 

This project tested my ability to use functions and helped me understand how they can be used in conjunction with other functions, as well as variables, to bring functionality to web pages.

Installation
